Hi there! 👋 

I'm João Vitor Lopes, a passionate programmer currently learning the ropes at Rocketseat and expanding my knowledge in Information Systems at college, UniAcademia. 
My goal is to become a skilled web developer, always striving to improve through learning and gaining hands-on experience.

My Public Projects 💻

1- Móveis Customizados: A project created to practice HTML and CSS. It simulates a platform that sells furniture:

2- Flutuar: It's similar to "Móveis Customizados". The idea is to also practice HTML and CSS. It simulates a platform that sells travel packages:
