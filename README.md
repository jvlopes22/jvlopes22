Hi there! üëã 

I'm Jo√£o Vitor Lopes, a passionate programmer currently expanding my knowledge at Rocketseat and pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the college UniAcademia. 
My goal is to become a skilled developer, always striving to improve through learning and gaining hands-on experience.

My Public Projects üíª

HTML and CSS:

 - Fotoblog: This project features a great type of design and animations. It simulates a photo gallery with images saved by the user.

 - treine.me: A project that shows a basic landing page that simulates a physical exercise training assistance service.

 - Flutuar: It simulates a platform that sells travel packages. The idea was to make a simple project to practice HTML and CSS.

 - M√≥veis Customizados: Similar to "Flutuar", it was a project created to practice HTML and CSS. It simulates a platform that sells furniture.
