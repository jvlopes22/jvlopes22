Hi there! 👋 

I'm João Vitor Lopes, a passionate programmer currently expanding my knowledge at Rocketseat and pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the college UniAcademia. 
My goal is to become a skilled developer, always striving to improve through learning and gaining hands-on experience.

My Public Projects 💻

1- Móveis Customizados: A project created to practice HTML and CSS. It simulates a platform that sells furniture.

2- Flutuar: It's similar to "Móveis Customizados". The idea is to also practice HTML and CSS. It simulates a platform that sells travel packages.
